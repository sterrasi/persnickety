# drawstrings
 
A straightforward Object-Relational Mapping library that relieves you of the following pain:
- overly complicated layers of abstraction
- having to learn a query language that hides SQL.
- 'magic' non-deterministic caching behavior
- high cost of entry and cost of ownership
- dependency hell

The _drawstrings_ ORM strives to be
- Declarative and DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself). 
- Easy to maintain using generated boilerpate code.
- Self contained and easy to test   
- Uses straight SQL
- Lightweight and extensible DAO pattern
- All dependencies are in the form of optional plugins (drawstrings-postgres, drawstrings-jackson)
